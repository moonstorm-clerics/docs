The Moonstorm Clerics are Clerics of the Tempest Domain, dedicated to the Selune.

Formerly of the Nature domain, Moonstorm Clerics have re(-sub-)classed from
defensive protectors to offensive activists, harnessing the moon's power to
fight Earth's would-be destroyers.

We draw our power from the moon, and express it through irresistable gravity and
awe-inspiring thunderstorms!
